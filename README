GOAL: Create a quick and easy system to help automate the book request process for our user group

WOULD LIKE TO SEE:
* validate user submitting request against meetup group via api
* simple form to add book request once user is validated
  ** title
  ** publisher
  ** electronic format if available
  ** created_at
* simple admin screen that will:
  ** view all requests
  ** ordered by newest first
  ** status that can be changed whether request has been made to publisher

WOULD LIKE TO SEE IN THE FUTURE:
* when book arrives, an email can be triggered to let requester know the book has arrived and they can pick it up at the next meeting.
